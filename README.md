# Memories of Devolution X

**What's the purpose of this repository?**

Okita Mizukito: I wanted to do a kang, a kang that no one in the community has ever done before.

**How do we (the community) participate?**

It's quite simple!

You create a folder in /KeepDevolving and name it using your GitHub username!

For example, KeepDevolving/RealOkita

Then create a file called KeepDevolving.ext3 (By .ext3 it can be .ext4, .f2fs, .erofs, .squashfs and much more!) then type KeepEvolving in your countries' language!

~~ Example ~~
KeepDevolving.ext4

`mkfs.ext4 -t "進化し続ける - With love from Tokyo, Japan"`

(You can make more than one KeepDevolving file, e.g. in erofs as KeepDevolving.erofs)
